            I am a Licensed Social Work Associate Independent Clinical in
            Washington (license# SC60868009). I hold a Master's of Social Work
            from the University of Washington, Seattle. <br /><br />
            I have been working in mental health for over ten years. I offer
            therapy services for individuals with various issues ranging from
            anxiety and depression to grief, loss, and workplace issues. My most
            recent job was as a mental health therapist in an acute psychiatric
            hospital. <br /><br />
            I work to provide a safe and respectful environment that promotes
            healing and opportunity for change. My approach includes
            Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI),
            and Mindfulness. It is ok to ask for help and feel sad, but focusing
            on your mental and emotional well-being is essential. Let's work
            together to identify techniques, tools, and resources that are
            suitable for you. <br /><br />
            I was born and raised in Indonesia, and I speak English and
            Indonesian fluently. I can provide therapy in English and Indonesian
            for Indonesian-speaking individuals.
